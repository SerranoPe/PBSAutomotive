# Project1
Name: Peter Serrano
Overview of Project: Webpage for my father's automotive business. He is a trained mechanic that buys/sells parts and builds engines.
Details: While going through the site, you will see pictures of cars and engines my father has worked on and view his Facebook page which includes more information on his work and his current offers for sale.
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Ideas for Future Improvements: I plan to fix the slideshows to look neater and organized as well as adding more features to the home page. I feel more could be expressed with the type of work my father does.
